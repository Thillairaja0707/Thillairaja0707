## 🌟 Projects

### Crop Disease Detection System- By using machine learning and image processing to identify plant
 diseases from leaf images. Implemented a CNN-based model for accurate classification and integrated it
 with a user-friendly interface for farmers. Aims to enhance early disease detection and improve crop yield
 through technology.
 
 ### Line Following Robot- By using infrared (IR) sensors and microcontroller programming to autonomously
 navigate a predefined path. Implemented PID control for smooth and efficient movement across curves
 and intersections. Useful for industrial automation, logistics, and smart transportation systems.
